Hi Rebecca.

Thanks again for taking the time to chat with us. Based on that, we'd like to invite you to the next step in the process: a skills assessment. In addition to letting you show off your coding and other skills, the process will be a good way for you to get a sense of how we think about and work through problems.

The product this hire will primarily be working on is an open source web application which helps people learn about and apply for affordable housing listings. Taking inspiration from that project, the goal of this take-home is to build a single page application using React to display this listing data.

 We highly recommend using `Create React App` with `Typescript` to get started which will set up a basic project for you.

You might find adding the json-loader package to be useful as well. We have attached a basic design mock which serves as a general idea of how you might choose to visually organize the data we are asking for - you do not have to follow it exactly.

The goals for this assessment are:

- display a list of all listings with their image and property name, sorted alphabetically by property name ✅
- calculate for each property and for each unit type within that property's set of units the following, displaying this data in a table associated with the property image
  - the average square footage of that unit type ✅
  - the range of possible occupancy of that unit type ✅
- create three inputs to filter the data

  1) a text input on the property name ✅

  2) a dropdown input to filter on a unit amenity

  3) two text inputs to filter on a minimum and maximum occupancy range

- paginate the listings, visually showing ✅
  - the number of records per page which a user can change ✅
  - an indication of the current page number ✅
  - a way to navigate between them ✅

We also ask that you consider writing tests, accessibility, and mobile compatibility given time. If you do not have time to write tests, it would be helpful to see just comments in a test file of what iterations of tests you would consider writing (Create React App sets up Jest and React Testing Library for you).

If you have time you can complete all of the goals, but do not stress about needing to finish them all. We want to be respectful of your time and don't anticipate you spending more than 5 hours. If you feel uncertain about completing any of the steps, prioritize the ones you are confident in completing.

We ask that you do not use any outside design system libraries (like Material UI or Bootstrap), but you are free to use more low-level CSS tools if you wish (like Tailwind, Emotion, SASS). The visual design of the project is not a priority above the functional pieces - design is not a part of this role, though expertise with front-end frameworks is.

You can share your project with us as a repo on GitHub (@seanmalbert, @emilyjablonski, @kramduckner) or as a zip file. We look forward to seeing it!

Once you're done, we'll have a 90 minute interview, where we'll talk a little about the assessment and have a technical conversation about your experience and skills overall. We want you to be able to work this into your schedule, so please let us know when you think you'll have it done and we can either schedule the meeting ahead of time or wait until you're done, depending on how hard of a deadline you would like to set.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about the details.

Thank you,
Exygy
